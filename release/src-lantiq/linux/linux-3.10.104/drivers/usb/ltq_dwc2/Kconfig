	  Say Y or M here if your system has a Dual Role HighSpeed
	  USB controller based on the DesignWare HSOTG IP Core.

	  If you choose to build this driver as dynamically linked
	  modules, the core module will be called dwc2.ko, the
	  PCI bus interface module (if you have a PCI bus system)
	  will be called dwc2_pci.ko and the platform interface module
	  (for controllers directly connected to the CPU) will be called
	  dwc2_platform.ko.

	  NOTE: This driver at present only implements the Host mode
	  of the controller. The existing s3c-hsotg driver supports
	  Peripheral mode, but only for the Samsung S3C platforms.
	  There are plans to merge the s3c-hsotg driver with this
	  driver in the near future to create a dual-role driver.
